                            <p> I was born in <span class="about-istanbul">Istanbul</span> in <span class="about-birth">1994</span> and I live here ever since.
                                Currently, I'm a <span class="about-position-amadeus">software development engineer</span> at <a class="a-amadeus" href="https://amadeus.com/en" target="_blank">
                                <span class="about-amadeus">Amadeus</span></a>. 
                                I graduated from <a class="a-dept" href="http://cse.eng.marmara.edu.tr/en/" target="_blank"><span class="about-dept">computer engineering</span></a> at <a class="a-university" href="http://www.marmara.edu.tr/en/" target="_blank"><span class="about-university">Marmara University</span></a> 
                                in <span class="about-grad">June 2018</span>.
                                During the fall semester of 2015-2016, I studied at <a class="a-warsaw" href="https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw" target="_blank"><span class="about-warsaw">Warsaw University of Technology</span></a> as an <span class="about-erasmus">Erasmus Exchange Student</span>. <br><br>
                                In the <span class="about-idate">summer of 2016</span>, I've interned with two different companies which are <a class="a-dmw" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/date-my-wardrobe/" target="_blank"><span class="about-dmw">Date My Wardrobe</span></a> 
                                and <a class="a-ziraat" href="https://www.ziraatteknoloji.com" target="_blank"><span class="about-ziraat">Ziraat Teknoloji</span></a>.<br>

                                I have worked closely with the CEO of Date My Wardrobe on both front and back ends during my internship, and I used mainly <span class="about-dmw-stack">Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL</span>.

                                    While I was an intern at Ziraat Teknoloji, I implemented a desktop application for determining investment preferences of customers. <span class="about-ziraat-stack">C# and PL/SQL</span> were the two most commonly used 
                                    technologies during this period.<br><br>
                                    In <span class="about-idate">June 2017</span>, I was an intern at <span class="about-dtvh">Doğan TV Holding</span>. Doğan TV Holding is an Istanbul based company which includes <span class="about-desc-dtvh">Kanal D, CNN Türk, D-Smart</span>, and many others. 
                                    During my internship, I have created D-Smart Channel Frequency List page which allows its users to figure out the frequencies of some TV channels. 
                                    I've also played a significant role on the frontend implementation of sitemap page of D-Smart website. During this period, I worked on the frontend using <span class="about-dtvh-stack">Bootstrap, HTML, CSS</span>.
